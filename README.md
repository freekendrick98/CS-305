-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client is Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that makes plans for indivudials regarding retirement, savings, investments, and insurance. Artemis needed a program to provide all of these services to their clients and needed it to be developed and secure. I had to address the bits and pieces of developed code as well as ad security measures and run dependency checks on the code looking for compilation errors.

-What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
The easiest part to identify as a problem was the versions of the spring boot being used. Outdated software is very prone to attack which makes monitoring things like that critical to a companies security. The company is only as strong and successful as its security, and it imformation is being tracked or tampered with by someone else, the company could loose partons.

-What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The vunrebility assesment was relativley easy to work through, especially with the how-to tutorials provided in the modules. Adding the neccesary elements to the pom.xml was easy to do and compiled even easier. 

-How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
The dependency check was a game changer for me. Having all of the compilation errors reviewed by the dependency check was incredibly time efficent. The dependency check also included the causes of the errors and how to go about fixing them.

-How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure no new vunrabilites were added I just kept running the dependency check to see if more vunrabilites were added or removed.

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized a lot of youtube tutorials as well as the websited provided in the modules.

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
Running the depencency check was the easiest thing to do and would be easy to showcase.
