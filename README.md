-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client is Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that makes plans for indivudials regarding retirement, savings, investments, and insurance. Artemis needed a program to provide all of these services to their clients and needed it to be developed and secure. I had to address the bits and pieces of developed code as well as ad security measures and run dependency checks on the code looking for compilation errors.

-What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
The easiest part to identify as a problem was the versions of the spring boot being used. Outdated software is very prone to attack which makes monitoring things like that critical to a companies security. The company is only as strong and successful as its security, and it imformation is being tracked or tampered with by someone else, the company could loose partons.

-What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

-How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

-How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
